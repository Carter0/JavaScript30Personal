## Javascript 30 Personal Project


Here are some projects involving just plain javascript. No frameworks or libraries or anything. All this was taken from Wes Anderson's Javacript 30 tutorial. 

Finished around tutorial 15. Have worked through the code up to 11. I felt like a get it after a while and I want to move on to something a bit more interesting to me.
